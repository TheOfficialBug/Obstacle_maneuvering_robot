# Obstacle_manuvering_robot
This intelligent robot is built with the help of Arduino UNO, Ultra Sonic sensor, and the servo motor. The ultrasonic sensor keeps transmitting the transmit waves and the receiver receives those waves once they hit the object ahead of them at a certain distance to avoid any such obstacles in its path of a directory, the robot finds a path on its own by navigating itself to a new path where it avoids such obstacles. This mechanism can be implemented in the military or any other autonomous tool where a manned vehicle cannot be launched.
